# fnc
Fuck Notification Center, a simple notification daemon that doesn't do anything.

---

## Installation
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/femmesexual/fnc --locked fnc

## What does it do?
Nothing. Using fnc there is no way to read your notifications.

## Why?
Some applications will crash if you do not use a notification daemon.
